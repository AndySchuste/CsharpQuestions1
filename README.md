Q: What is a namespace?

A namespace is used to organize classes. For example system is a namespace and the console is a class in that namespace.

Q: What are value types?

Variables that store actual values inside of them. Examples are int, double, char, etc.

Q: What are reference types?

A stored value rather than holding a value inside of its self. Examples an object, string, etc.

Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?

A property that is built in to the C# compiler. This is seen in get and set methods and is type safe while leading to faster and shorter code.

Q: What is the purpose of using statement?

Used to decide which namespace is going to be used for the program.

Q: What are dynamic type variables?

Examples are value types, int, reference types, ect. 

Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?

Tells whether an object is of a certain type

Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
Generics are ways to simplify code reuse, type safety, and to increase performance of the program. It is a class that allows the user to use methods or interfaces as a parameter.
 

Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
The scope is open to any other class in the program. Public allows a member to be accessed throughout the program.


Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?

Yes

Q: How do you sort an array?

ArrayName.Sort 

Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
Nullable types allow the user to set a variable to a null value as well as a normal positive or negative value


Q: What is an enumeration?
A type of reference that allows the user to set specific values as named constants. An example would be enum Gender that contains Male or Female.



Q: What is inheritance?

A class can inherit properties, fields, and attributes from a base class or parent class.


Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?

No

Q: What is the purpose of as operator

Acts to set compatible value types as one another.

Q: What is an object?

It is able to hold any value, reference, or dynamic type

Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?


Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?

Continue statements let the code go on while a break statement ends the code 


Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?

Try is used to attempt to read the code and catch is used to catch the exception

Q: How is exception handling done?

By using specific statements such as the Try statement

Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?

Finally is ran after the inital code and is used to catch exceptions

Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.

An Array needs to know how many objects it is going to hold when an ArrayList is more flexible becuase the code does not have to be defined as to how many objects it can hold.


Q: What is an object?

It is able to hold any value, reference, or dynamic type


Q: Define constructor.

Special method of the class that contains the set of instructions for an object when it is created.


Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?

Var can be used when the program can implicitly write out a variable and decide what kind of value type to assign to it.

Q: What is an abstract class?

It is used to define a base class in a program. Using abstraction, the base class is just referred to without explaining what it does in total.


Q: What is an interface?

The interface instructs the classes that derive from it what to do. Those classes then determine how they need to do it.


Q: What is a method?

A group of statements that accomplish a task. This is shown when a method makes an object print out a statement.


Q: What is a property?

 Provide a felxible way or reading, writing, or changing files in the program. For example, Get and Set are both properties.


Q: What is an access specifier?

Keywords that specify what level of access the variable can be seen/reached from.


Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
Keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members


Q: What is a collection?

A way to store variables that can be taken out or put into the collection. Some examples are Stacks, Arraylists, Queues, etc.

Q: What is a Hash Table?

A Hash Table is a structure that maps keys to specific values.
