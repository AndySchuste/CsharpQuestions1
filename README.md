Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?

Var can be used when the program can implicitly write out a variable and decide what kind of value type to assign to it.

Q: What is an abstract class?

It is used to define a base class in a program. Using abstraction, the base class is just referred to without explaining what it does in total.


Q: What is an interface?

Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?




Q: What is a collection?
